## Forecasting Financial Indicators with ARIMA & SARIMA

# A Time Series Modeling Pipeline Using yFinance and Python

This project explores the use of classical time series forecasting techniques to model financial market indicators derived from daily historical data. Drawing data directly from Yahoo Finance, it focuses on predicting financial trends using statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA. The project aims to demonstrate how traditional forecasting methods can remain effective and interpretable, even amidst the proliferation of more complex machine learning models.

The analysis centers on key market variables such as adjusted closing prices, returns, and volatility for selected financial indices. After data cleaning and transformation, statistical diagnostics and visualizations are used to examine patterns, stationarity, and potential seasonality in the series. These insights inform model selection and parameter tuning, ensuring methodological rigor in forecasting performance.

Forecasting results are quantitatively evaluated using common metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. In addition, visualization plays a critical role, with forecast intervals and prediction overlays helping to validate model accuracy and communicate uncertainty. Comparative analysis between ARIMA and SARIMA highlights the advantages of incorporating seasonality in certain contexts, particularly for cyclical financial series.

Overall, this project serves as a practical and interpretable application of classical time series forecasting in the financial domain. It showcases a clean and reusable framework for future analysis while reinforcing that foundational statistical methods continue to offer strong value in exploratory forecasting, benchmarking, and decision support.
